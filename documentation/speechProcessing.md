# Multilingual Speech Transcription System - Technical Documentation

## System Overview

The Multilingual Speech Transcription System is a robust speech-to-text solution supporting multiple languages (English, Hindi, and Tamil) with advanced signal processing and deep learning capabilities. The system combines traditional signal processing techniques with modern deep learning approaches to achieve accurate transcription across different acoustic environments.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Language Configuration (LanguageConfig)

The system uses a configuration-based approach to handle multiple languages:

- Each language has specific parameters:
  - Character set (labels)
  - Pre-trained model path
  - Frequency cutoff values optimized for language characteristics
  - Custom bandpass filter parameters

Example configuration:
```python
{
    'labels': [...],  # Language-specific character set
    'wav2vec_model': "model_path",
    'lowcut': frequency_value,
    'highcut': frequency_value
}
```

### 2. Signal Processing Pipeline (AdvancedSignalPreprocessor)

The signal preprocessing pipeline implements multiple stages of enhancement:

#### a. Bandpass Filtering
- Uses Butterworth filter to remove frequencies outside speech range
- Language-specific frequency bands (e.g., 300-3000Hz for English)
- Implementation uses scipy.signal for efficient filtering

#### b. Noise Reduction
- Implements spectral subtraction technique
- Process:
  1. Compute Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
  2. Estimate noise profile from initial frames
  3. Subtract scaled noise profile from magnitude spectrum
  4. Reconstruct signal using inverse STFT

#### c. Speech Enhancement
- Complete pipeline combining multiple techniques:
  1. Bandpass filtering
  2. Noise reduction
  3. Pitch correction using WORLD vocoder
  4. Signal normalization

### 3. Feature Extraction (AdvancedFeatureExtractor)

Implements multi-dimensional feature extraction:

#### a. Mel Spectrogram
- Parameters:
  - 80 mel bands
  - 2048-point FFT
  - 512-point hop length
- Provides frequency representation aligned with human perception

#### b. Additional Features
- MFCC (13 coefficients)
- Spectral centroids
- Chroma features
- Harmonic-percussive source separation

### 4. Neural Network Architecture (AdvancedSpeechModel)

The model implements a hybrid architecture combining multiple deep learning techniques:

#### a. Multi-scale Convolution
- Parallel convolutional paths with different kernel sizes (3, 5, 7)
- Captures patterns at different temporal scales
- Each path includes:
  - 1D convolution
  - Batch normalization
  - ReLU activation
  - Dropout (0.3)

#### b. Bidirectional LSTM
- 3 layers with bidirectional processing
- Hidden size: 512
- Dropout between layers
- Captures temporal dependencies

#### c. Self-Attention Mechanism
- Multi-head attention (8 heads)
- Captures long-range dependencies
- Scaled dot-product attention implementation

#### d. Output Layers
- CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) layer
- Supports variable-length input sequences

## Signal Processing Details

### 1. Why Bandpass Filtering?

- Speech frequencies typically fall within 300-3000Hz
- Removes environmental noise outside speech range
- Language-specific ranges account for different phonetic characteristics
- Butterworth filter chosen for flat frequency response in passband

### 2. Noise Reduction Strategy

The spectral subtraction approach:
```python
stft = librosa.stft(signal)
noise_profile = np.mean(np.abs(stft[:, :5]), axis=1)
enhanced_magnitude = np.maximum(magnitude - noise_threshold * noise_profile[:, np.newaxis], 0)
```

- Uses first few frames for noise estimation
- Dynamic threshold prevents musical noise
- Phase preservation maintains speech naturalness

### 3. Feature Extraction Rationale

Multiple features capture different aspects of speech:
- Mel spectrograms: frequency content aligned with human perception
- MFCCs: vocal tract configuration
- Spectral centroids: brightness/sharpness of sound
- Chroma: tonal content
- Harmonic features: voiced speech components

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Memory Efficiency

- Use torch.no_grad() for inference
- Implement batch processing where possible
- Clean up CUDA cache between processing steps

### 2. Real-time Processing

- Buffer size considerations for audio recording
- Streaming-compatible preprocessing
- Efficient feature computation

### 3. Error Handling

- Graceful degradation with poor audio quality
- Language detection fallback
- Hardware capability checking

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Initialize system
transcription_system = SpeechTranscriptionSystem(language='english')

# Record and transcribe
results = transcription_system.transcribe()

# Process existing audio
audio_array = load_audio('speech.wav')
results = transcription_system.transcribe(audio=audio_array)
```

### Multi-language Processing
```python
# Process multiple languages
languages = ['english', 'hindi', 'tamil']
for lang in languages:
    system = SpeechTranscriptionSystem(language=lang)
    results = system.transcribe()
```
